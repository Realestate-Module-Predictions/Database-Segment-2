We collectively agreed on using the tools and knowledge given to us during this course to manipulate, store, perform ETL and analysis on data. We will train a machine learning on prices of sold inactive listings to predict how much the currently listed unsold units would be sold for in Toronto. 

✓ Description of their source of data
---
- The Data Source used is a CSV file including all the listings sold and still listed since (1st Jan 2020 till 10th Jan 2022).
- Originally a google sheet, which we cleaned, edited, downloaded as a csv file.
- It has been imported into Postgres PGAdmin using AWS. It has also been connected to Jupyter files.
- Latitudes and Longitudes of listings addresses was also added to the data. 
- The data consists of number of features such as Location, Rooms (Bed,wash and extra), Municipality, Garage Type, Heating etc.
